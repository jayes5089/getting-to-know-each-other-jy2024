            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Plainfield South High School in 2020 when Covid started, then 
            from JJC in 2022 with 2 Associate’s Degrees in Arts and Science. I am currently 
            in my last semester at Lewis University, and I will be graduating this spring with
            a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. 
            <br><br>
            I live with my parents, brother, and sister-in-law in Plainfield, and I plan to stay 
            in the area for the long run. I am a first generation college student, as my parents
            both came from Durango, Mexico, and I hope to earn my Bachelor’s just like my older
            sister and brother did.

            <h2>What I hope to learn in this course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A better understanding of the software development cycle, aswell as improve
                my coding skills in general.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>Practice methods of security within my code, as well as identify what portions
                of security in my code may need more attention.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>Familiarize myself with Javascript, practice making visually cleaner websites, and
                have some fun coding in a language I like.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="hobbies">
            <h2>My favorite hobbies and activities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I like playing video games with my cousin. We’re into Helldivers 2 and Rocket Leauge
                 at the moment. Usually when I play alone, I play on The Binding of Isaac.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>I got into 3D printing recently. I found a printer in a school dumpster, so I’m teaching
                myself to create objects in Fusion and try to work with an obsolete printer until it gives out.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>If you see me in class and I’m not paying attention, I’m probably playing solitare.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>Some of this code came from a previous getting to know each other assignment that I did
            back in spring 2023. I made the wallpaper from this website by taking a photo in a pitch black room
            with max exposure on.
            </br></br>
            I’ve driven to somewhere around 10 to 15 states. I visited Canada, Spain, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and many states in Mexico.
            To be honest, I’ve never really enjoyed travelling even out of state because I get too homesick.
            </br></br>
            To this day, I still haven’t contracted Covid. I’m hoping to keep it that way since it sounds horrible.
